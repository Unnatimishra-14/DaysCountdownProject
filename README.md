## Project Overview

The Days Countdown Project is a Python script that takes user input for a goal and its deadline. It then calculates the number of days remaining until the user needs to complete their goal. The script utilizes the `datetime` module to handle date calculations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Python installed on your machine
- datetime module is installed
   ```
  pip install datetime

   ```
  

## Usage

To use the Days Countdown Project script, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Unnatimishra-14/DaysCountdownProject.git
   cd DaysCountdownProject
   ```

2. Run the `main.py` script:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

3. Enter your goal and its deadline in the format `goal:deadline` (e.g., "Finish project:31.12.2023").

4. The script will calculate and display the number of days left to complete your goal.

5. The script will display a "Thank You!" message.
